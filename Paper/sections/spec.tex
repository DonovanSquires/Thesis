%[This is a list of specifications for the combined software and hardware.  It might be better understood if these were called "requirements"]

The Data Acquisition and Stimulation System (DASS) is expected to provide to following functionality:

\begin{enumerate}

\item Provide a platform for performing electrophysiology experiments with earthworms as described in~\cite{Olivo,KuehJellies}

	\begin{enumerate}
	
	\item Produce a voltage-controlled square wave stimulation pulse with widths from 0.01ms to 100ms and amplitudes from 0.1V to 10V
	
	\item Produce single stimulation pulses or multiple pulses at rates from 1Hz to 10Hz
	
	\item Provide at least one differential recording channel
	
	\item Record an action potential voltage from the time of a stimulation pulse for a minimum duration of 20ms
	
	\item Plot the recorded voltage
	
	\item Store the recorded voltage to a non-proprietary, standard file format
	
	\end{enumerate}
	

\item Provide a platform for stimulation and recording of neuron cell culture electrical activity via MEA electrodes

	\begin{enumerate}
	
	\item Provide at least four recording channels
	
	\item Store data from recording channels continuously
	
	\item Provide at least four voltage-controlled arbitrary stimulation channels
	
	\item Output single-ended stimulation signals on recording electrodes and add culture voltage offset to the stimulation signal
	
	\item Provide an interface that can specify stimulation waveforms, locations, and intervals that can be updated based on data from the recording electrodes
	
	\end{enumerate}

\item Utilize Low-Noise Amplifier described in~\cite{StahlMSEE}

	\begin{enumerate}
	
	\item Connect to each Low-Noise Amplifier channel with a PCI-Express card edge connector
	
	\item Provide $\pm 7\unit{V}$ to $\pm 15\unit{V}$ analog voltage supplies and ground via the card edge connector
	
	\item Provide ability to independently switch four digital inputs for each channel, $0_{\mathrm{IH}}=0.8\unit{V}$ and $1_{\mathrm{IL}}=2.4\unit{V}$
	
	\item Route differential analog input to the card edge connector for each channel
	
	\item Convert the 20Hz to 14.6kHz analog output signal~\cite{StahlMSEE} to digital samples %with a resolution better than (XX)$V/LSB$ [check with references or base number on oscilloscope resolution]
	
	\item Route a single-ended stimulation signal to each channel
	
	\end{enumerate}
	
\item Additional requirements

	\begin{enumerate}
	
%	\item Produce arbitrary stimulation waveforms with minimum bandwidth (XX)$Hz$ and minimum slew rate (XX)$V / \mu s$
	
	\item Employ proven, effective circuit design and layout best practices
	
%	[Anything else that doesn't fit in the above categories]
	
	\end{enumerate}
	
\end{enumerate}
