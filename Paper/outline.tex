\section{Electrophysiology Interface Board Schematic}\label{sec:schematic}

The following is the hierarchical schematic for the Electrophysiology Interface Board.  The schematic was created using the KiCAD open source EDA software suite.

The first page of the schematic contains most of the connectors on the Electrophysiology Interface Board.  Hierarchical blocks in the first schematic page represent following schematic pages with labels on the blocks corresponding to net names in the schematic page represented by the block.  All signals have a scope only within a single schematic page save for the power supply nets, which have a global scope.  The power supply input connectors are shown on page~\pageref{SchematicRev1r0.14}, and since the power nets are global, the hierarchical block on page~\pageref{SchematicRev1r0.1} representing power input connector page, page~\pageref{SchematicRev1r0.14}, is empty of labels.

\section{Bill of Materials}\label{sec:bom}

Table~\ref{tab:bom} in this section shows the list of components used to populate the Electrophysiology Interface board.  Information from the KiCAD EDA suite, such as reference designator, footprint name (Package), and component value (Designation), is aligned with data from the part supplier, DigiKey\textsuperscript{\textregistered}, such as part number and unit price at the time of purchase.

\section{Revision 1.0 Errata}\label{sec:errata}

Table~\ref{tab:errata} is a description of the problems with the first revision of the Electrophysiology Interface Board that require rework of the PCB for it to work as desired or that should be fixed if another board is ordered (Rev1.1)
