# Figures

Most of the figures in this directory were produced using [Dia](https://wiki.gnome.org/Apps/Dia).  To be consistent with the LaTeX document, the text in the Dia figures uses otf fonts from [Computer Modern Unicode](http://canopus.iacp.dvo.ru/~panov/cm-unicode/).

Dia's pdf and tex/latex outputs were not very good, so the following process was used to produce a pdf figure of the Dia document:
